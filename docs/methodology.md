Δa₂ Methodology & Evaluation Checklist

1. Synthetic baseline: run multiple seeds, report mean Δa₂ and CI.
2. Model-backed replication: run small models (GPT-2 / Pythia) and compute layerwise Δa₂.
3. Pair with self-report prompts and compute Pearson r + bootstrap CI.
4. Include security checklist and sandbox instructions.
