Δa₂ Research Pitch — One Page

Problem: Output-only detectors can miss internal representational shifts.
Proposal: Δa₂ — an activation-covariance curvature metric — as an internal early-warning side channel.
Deliverables: Code, whitepaper, notebook, experiments. Ready for institutional review and sandboxed evaluation.
Asks: Run synthetic baseline; consider small-model replication (GPT-2/Pythia); request short demo.
